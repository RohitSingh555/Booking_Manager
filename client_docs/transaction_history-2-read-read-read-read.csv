          (https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
        Contact us as soon as you can if you think your statement or
        receipt is wrong or if you need more information about
        a transfer on the statement or receipt. We must hear from

        1. Tell us your name and username or phone number.
        2. Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about,
